Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a 2023 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It is based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, and features a narrative inspired by its long-running comic book mythology which is also derived from various adaptations in other media. It is the third entry in the Marvel's Spider-Man series, acting as a sequel to Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) and a follow-up to Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020). The plot follows Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they come into conflict with Kraven the Hunter, who transforms New York City into a hunting ground for super-powered individuals; and with the extraterrestrial Venom symbiote, which bonds itself to Peter and negatively influences him, threatening to destroy his personal relationships.

The gameplay builds on the foundation established by its predecessors, with an emphasis on the multiple playstyles afforded by Peter Parker and Miles Morales as Spider-Men. The game expands on their existing traversal and combat abilities, including new web-based gadgets and suits that can be unlocked through progressing in the story. It also introduces the former Spider-Man's symbiote suit, granting Parker unique abilities from his previous playable appearance. As with the prior games, content outside the main story consists of completing side-missions and obtaining collectibles dispersed throughout the game's open world, with the player able to switch between Parker and Morales to complete dedicated objectives for each of them.

Discussions regarding a proper sequel to Marvel's Spider-Man began during the game's development, with open story threads for future titles being teased across both it and Miles Morales. The game was announced in September 2021. Creative director Bryan Intihar, game director Ryan Smith, narrative lead Jon Paquette and art director Jacinda Chew from Insomniac Games respectively reprise their duties from prior entries, while Yuri Lowenthal, Nadji Jeter and Laura Bailey return to headline the game's ensemble voice cast, which comprises other returning actors and characters from the previous games. Jim Pirri and Tony Todd join the ensemble as the voices of Kraven and Venom, respectively.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was released for the PlayStation 5 on October 20, 2023. The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed towards its narrative, characterization, and gameplay. It was nominated for numerous end-of-year accolades, and won in six categories at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, including Action Game of the Year. The game sold over 2.5 million units in 24 hours and over five million in 11 days, becoming PlayStation's fastest selling first-party title. The game has sold over 11 million units as of April 2024. A Windows port of the game, developed by Nixxes Software, is set for release on January 30, 2025.[1]
Gameplay

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an action-adventure single-player[2] video game played from a third-person perspective. As with the first game Peter Parker and Miles Morales are the two main characters, with Mary Jane and Venom[3] playable in certain missions, becoming individually playable in accordance with the story as they traverse an open world New York City and fight enemies.[4] Players can acquire new abilities and collect various Spider-Man suits. Peter and Miles can be freely swapped between at any point during free-roam in the game's open world, and have dedicated missions both in the main story and as part of side content that takes advantage of their individual traits.[5] The game expands upon the prior entries' open world, allowing players to explore Brooklyn and Queens in addition to Manhattan, which was the main setting of the previous two games.[6]

Building on the combat system of the previous titles, both Spider-Men are able to parry physical attacks, as certain enemy types are impervious to dodging. During traversal, both Peter and Miles' new suits come equipped with Web Wings, which, when deployed, allow them to glide across the city, with their speed and distance covered increasing when taking advantage of areas such as wind tunnels. Each Spider-Man's gadget wheel has been upgraded with additional equippable mods for their web-shooters, such as being able to cast a Web Line across pillars for additional footing during stealth sequences suspended above enemies, and the Web Grabber, allowing multiple enemies to be pulled into an isolated spot for Stealth Takedowns, which can be performed on two enemies at once. In addition to Peter Parker's standard gameplay, he is playable when bonded to the Venom symbiote, granting him tendrils that he can use in combat and unique web-based abilities.[7] Both Spider-Men have individual Skill Trees with additional unlockable abilities for both of them once they accumulate enough Skill Points in accordance with their experience level, as well as a third Skill Tree dedicated to shared abilities between them.[8][9]

Yuri Lowenthal in 2018 (left) and Nadji Jeter in 2023. They voiced the game's two main protagonists, Peter Parker and Miles Morales, respectively.

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set 10 months after the events of Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020).[10] As with previous installments in the series, it features a large ensemble cast of various characters derived from the history of Spider-Man comics and other media. The game follows Peter Parker (Yuri Lowenthal) and Miles Morales (Nadji Jeter), who both became the superhero Spider-Man after gaining superhuman abilities upon being bitten by genetically modified spiders. Peter serves as a mentor to Miles, who gained his superpowers during the events of the first game, though he struggles with balancing his personal life and duties as the city's protector. They are supported by several allies: Daily Bugle reporter and Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Laura Bailey); Miles' classmate and tech guru Ganke Lee (Griffin Puatu); city councilwoman and Miles' mother Rio (Jacqueline Piñol); deaf street artist Hailey Cooper (Natasha Ofili); and Miles' estranged uncle Aaron Davis (Ike Amadi), who previously operated as the Prowler.

Other characters in the game include former New York mayor and Oscorp CEO Norman Osborn (Mark Rolston) and his son, Peter and Mary Jane's best friend Harry Osborn (Graham Phillips), who suffers from a neurological disease inherited from his mother, Emily;[11] Yuri Watanabe (Tara Platt), a disgraced former police captain and ally of Peter who has assumed the vigilante identity of "Wraith" following the events of The City That Never Sleeps;[12] J. Jonah Jameson (Darin De Paul), the Daily Bugle's chief editor and Mary Jane's boss; Danika Hart (Ashly Burch), host of the "Danikast" podcast; Peter's deceased aunt, May (Nancy Linari), who is featured in a flashback; and Miles' late father, Officer Jefferson Davis (Russell Richardson), who appears in a dream sequence.

Throughout the city, the two Spider-Men are faced with several supervillains such as Venom (Tony Todd), an extraterrestrial symbiote capable of bonding to human bodies and granting regenerative powers while negatively influencing their behavior; Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven the Hunter (Jim Pirri), the leader of a faction of mercenaries called the "Hunters" who seek to hunt super-powered beings;[13] and Cletus Kasady (Chad Doreck), also known as "The Flame", the head of a nihilistic cult who seeks to perform a demonic ritual to bring about an eschatological event dubbed the "Crimson Hour".[14] Returning villains from the first game include Martin Li / Mister Negative (Stephen Oyoung), Mac Gargan / Scorpion (Jason Spisak), Lonnie Lincoln / Tombstone (Corey Jones), and Felicia Hardy / Black Cat (Erica Lindbeck). Additional antagonists who were referenced in prior entries make full appearances in Spider-Man 2, including Flint Marko / Sandman (Leandro Cano), a lowly burglar who, through an accident, gained the ability to turn into molecules of sand and manipulate them at will; Curt Connors / Lizard (Mark Whitten), an Oscorp scientist who transformed into a giant reptilian creature;[15] Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon (Jim Pirri), a criminal master of disguises and Kraven's half-brother; and Quentin Beck / Mysterio (Noshir Dalal), a visual effects artist and reformed criminal who became the head developer of a virtual reality entertainment attraction called "Mysterium".[16][10] Furthermore, Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus (William Salyers), who is incarcerated in the Raft after the events of the first game, appears in a mid-credits scene.

The character Cindy Moon makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the game's post-credits scene, along with her father Albert Moon. The character Delilah, a skilled assassin who serves as the bartender at the Bar with No Name in an alternate universe, makes a cameo appearance during "The Message" side-quest. This version of the character was originally intended to appear in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) before her scene was cut from the final film.[17]
Plot

Peter starts his first day as a physics teacher at Brooklyn Visions Academy with Miles among his students, but they are interrupted by a rampaging Sandman, requiring both Spider-Men to subdue him. Fired for abandoning the class, Peter returns to his Aunt May's home in Queens–which he has moved into following her death[b]–to meet with Mary Jane. They are surprised by Harry, who has miraculously recovered from his terminal illness. Harry hires Peter to work at his environmental technology startup, the Emily-May Foundation (Named after Aunt May and Harry's mother Emily), so they can pursue his dream of "healing the world". Concurrently, Kraven and his Hunters infiltrate New York.

While overseeing a prisoner transfer, a vengeful Miles fails to stop the Hunters from capturing Martin Li, who previously killed his father Jefferson Davis.[b] While investigating Kraven, Peter discovers he is hunting super-powered individuals in search of an "equal" before he dies of cancer. Having already killed Scorpion, Rhino, Vulture, Shocker, and Electro, Kraven attempts to capture Black Cat. However, Miles helps her escape to Paris. While visiting Coney Island to reconnect, Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry witness the Hunters attack the park to capture a reformed Tombstone. While Peter rescues civilians, he is assisted by a super-powered Harry, who learns about Peter's double life and reveals that he was cured by Curt Connors via a powerful organic exosuit that physically augments his body, on his father Norman Osborn’s insistence.

With the exosuit's powers rapidly developing, Harry helps Peter rescue Tombstone while Mary Jane discovers that Kraven has kidnapped Connors. The trio attempt to save Connors, but Kraven forcibly turns him back into the Lizard. Kraven mortally wounds Peter, who is saved when the exosuit transfers itself to his body. After Peter confronts the Hunters with his newly enhanced powers, Kraven develops an interest in hunting Peter personally.

After Peter and Harry synthesize an antidote for Connors, Peter locates him with Miles' help and eventually defeats and cures him. Upon seeing Peter wearing the exosuit, Connors explains that it is actually an alien called a symbiote, which Oscorp obtained years prior, and warns Peter to destroy it. Under the symbiote's corrupting influence, Peter refuses and keeps it for himself despite learning that Harry's illness has returned, straining their friendship. As Peter goes on a symbiote-induced rampage against the Hunters, Kraven captures Miles and forces him to fight Li. Miles overcomes his anger towards Li and helps him escape, directing him to find Peter. Once Li informs him of Miles' location, Peter arrives to storm Kraven’s fortress in an effort to rescue him and nearly kills Kraven before Miles intervenes and convinces him to remove the symbiote.

Peter takes the symbiote to Oscorp to destroy it, but a desperate Harry intercepts him and reclaims it, transforming into a monstrous creature. After slaughtering Oscorp staff who are preparing to remove the symbiote from him, the symbiote-induced Harry escapes into Times Square, where he kills several of Kraven's Hunters before overpowering and killing Kraven himself. Introducing itself as Venom, the symbiote convinces Harry to "heal the world" by infecting everyone in it with symbiotes, starting with New York. Amidst this, Venom transforms Mary Jane into Scream, but Peter helps her break free after battling and reconciling with her. As Peter and Miles attempt to stop Venom, Peter is debilitated by a trace amount of the symbiote still in him. After Miles settles his differences with Li, the latter uses his powers to convert it into the Anti-Venom symbiote, which can destroy other symbiotes. Concurrently, Venom recovers the meteorite that originally brought him to Earth and empowers himself with it, accelerating the invasion. Peter and Miles distract Venom while Mary Jane steals the meteorite and destroys it with the EMF's particle accelerator, destroying Venom's spawn. At Harry's insistence, Peter destroys Venom, freeing Harry from its control, but rendering Harry comatose.

In the aftermath, Mary Jane quits the Daily Bugle to run her own podcast and moves in with Peter, who opts to take a break from being Spider-Man to focus on rebuilding the EMF, trusting Miles to protect the city. Norman blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery and visits an imprisoned Otto Octavius to demand their secret identities, but Octavius refuses, taking glee in Norman's suffering. Miles completes his college essay and meets Rio's new boyfriend, Albert Moon, who introduces them to his daughter Cindy.
Development

Both the first game and its spin-off title Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales (2020) included implicit teases toward future titles, including post-credits scenes alluding to Insomniac Games' intentions to introduce Venom into their narrative, as well as feature Norman Osborn and his son Harry in more prominent roles.[18] Intihar stated that Insomniac Games had discussed including the Black Suit as an unlockable costume during the development of the first game, but a meeting with Insomniac art director Gavin Goulden, Marvel Games vice president Bill Rosemann and senior director Eric Monacelli, convinced them that the symbiote would have to play a more significant role in their Spider-Man story to justify its inclusion.[19] When unveiling Miles Morales at Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal event in June 2020, Insomniac stated that a standalone title featuring Miles as the protagonist would not detract from the fact they had "much of Peter's story left to tell" in future games.[20]

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and sister title Marvel's Wolverine were jointly announced by Insomniac Games at the PlayStation Showcase event in September 2021.[21] Bryan Intihar and Ryan Smith serve as the game's creative and game directors, respectively reprising their roles from Marvel's Spider-Man,[2] while Yuri Lowenthal, Nadji Jeter, and Tony Todd star as Peter Parker, Miles Morales, and Venom, respectively.[22] Speaking on the This Week in Marvel podcast, Bill Rosemann described the game's narrative as "a little darker", as well as "the next big chapter". He likened the story's tone to The Empire Strikes Back (1980), contrasted with how Marvel's Spider-Man's narrative felt tonally similar to the original Star Wars (1977).[23]

In January 2022, Brittney Morris, who previously wrote the Miles Morales tie-in novel Wings of Fury, joined the writing team on the game;[24] and in June freelance artist Davison Carvalho was hired to serve as the game's art director. Carvalho had also served as a concept artist for various Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films.[25] That November, actor Scott Porter, who voiced Harry Osborn throughout the Research Station activities in the first game, revealed that he was recast in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 to accommodate the character's more prominent role in the story, addressing potential issues such as the age gap between himself and the character as "they decided to go photorealistic".[26] Actor Graham Phillips was later announced to take over the role of Osborn from Porter during San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023.[11]

Lowenthal discussed his portrayal of Peter Parker as he is under the influence of the Venom symbiote, citing "behaviors of addiction" as a major inspiration on how he would differentiate his two vocal performances at different points in the game. He additionally likened his delivery as Symbiote Spider-Man to his time voicing the character Sasuke Uchiha in the anime series Naruto, which was a stark contrast in tone to the "plucky young heroes" he was used to playing due to Sasuke's comparatively downbeat personality, and having to "dig a little bit" to emulate the character's angst.[27][28] The game would not depict Eddie Brock as the symbiote's host, a deviation from the majority of Spider-Man media featuring the character. Intihar cited a desire to tell an original story that stood apart from both the comics and various films featuring Venom while respecting the roots of the character.[29] Intihar asserted that they never intend to interpret a character so differently from other appearances at the risk of alienating fans, but they did want to provide a unique take on the material that felt tied to their franchise, citing the creative liberties taken with Peter Parker's Advanced Suit in the first game as an example, and how despite the adherence to classic elements like the red and blue color scheme, the enlarged, white spider emblem on the suit's chest distinguished the character as Insomniac's version of Spider-Man among other adaptations.[19] The game had gone gold in late September, one month before release.[30]
Marketing

The game's gameplay reveal debuted during Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation Showcase event in May 2023, highlighting a mission within the game's main story campaign that showed Peter Parker adorning the symbiote suit, and Miles Morales / Spider-Man, as the pair intercepted an attempt by Kraven's Hunters to capture Dr. Curt Connors as his transformation into the Lizard resulted in him breaking into a fish market near the New York City docks.[31] As part of the game's promotion, a separate splice of gameplay was featured in a scene from the film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), which depicted Miles Morales' roommate Ganke Lee playing the game on his PlayStation 5 console at their dorm. The sequence showed Peter Parker / Spider-Man initiating a takedown on a common thug using the spider-leg appendages equipped at the back of his new Advanced Suit.[32] Concept art of the Spider-Men combatting both Kraven the Hunter and Venom was presented at Summer Game Fest 2023, where creative director Bryan Intihar appeared as a guest to discuss the game's story and unveil the game's launch date and box art.[33] The game's main theme, "Greater Together" composed by John Paesano, was previewed at The Game Awards 10-Year Concert in June 2023, and was released on music streaming services shortly thereafter.[34] Intihar, along with producer Bill Rosemann from Marvel Games, Lowenthal, Jeter, Bailey and Todd, presented a Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023, titled "Symbiotic Relationships". The panel divulged further story and character details and was accompanied by the debut of a story trailer, and the unveiling of commemorative PlayStation 5 console bundles and accessories to coincide with the game's launch.[35] A gameplay overview narrated by creative director Bryan Intihar was featured as part of the PlayStation State of Play presentation in September 2023, in conjunction with preview events being held for media journalists in Los Angeles, where more extensive demos and playable builds of the game were showcased.[36] The game's launch trailer was released online on October 15, 2023 during New York Comic Con.[37]
Tie-in media and merchandise

A tie-in prequel comic was released by Marvel Comics on Free Comic Book Day in May 2023, written by Marvel's Spider-Man writer Christos Gage and illustrated by Ig Guara. Taking place after the events of Miles Morales, the narrative features Peter Parker, Miles Morales and Mary Jane Watson struggling to balance their individual responsibilities and the former's respective duties to New York as Spider-Men, and features The Hood as its main antagonist, who is attempting to procure an allegedly ancient tablet inscrypted with magic tomes to resuscitate his dying mother. The game's narrative director and Marvel's Spider-Man co-writer Jon Paquette elaborated on the writing team's interest in introducing The Hood for the comic, stating that they were interested in exploring the idea of the two Spider-Men having to confront a threat with powers beyond their understanding.[38][39][40]
Release

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was released for the PlayStation 5 on October 20, 2023.[41] A New Game Plus mode was released on March 7, 2024.[42] A Windows port of the game, developed by Nixxes Software, is set for release on January 30, 2025.[1]

Alongside the standard edition, a Digital Deluxe Edition was made available for the game. This edition features two sets of five unique suits for Peter Parker and Miles Morales, designed by guest artists from PlayStation Studios and the wider entertainment industry. It includes additional frames, stickers for the in-game Photo Mode, and two extra skill points for ability unlocks. A Collector's Edition will be distributed through participating retailers and PlayStation Direct. It contains a download voucher for the Digital Deluxe Edition, a steel bookcase, and a 19-inch display statue depicting the Spider-Men fighting Venom. All pre-orders, regardless of edition, come with early unlock bonuses: the "Arachknight Suit" for Peter Parker and "Shadow-Spider Suit" for Miles Morales, the Web Grabber gadget, and three additional skill points.[43]

To commemorate the game's launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment distributed a special edition PlayStation 5 console bundle themed after the game on September 1, 2023. It is a variant of the standard PlayStation 5 sporting custom face plates and a unique DualSense controller design based on the imagery of the Venom symbiote wrapping itself around a red gradient adorning Peter Parker's Spider-Man emblem. Insomniac Games art director Jacinda Chew remarked on this design being evocative of the various ways players experience the symbiote taking over Peter in the game's story, describing it as a "constant push and pull for dominance whether it's internal or external and the outcome is not certain."[44] The console comes with a digital voucher for the game's Standard Edition for pre-load ahead of launch. The face plates and special DualSense controller are sold as separate accessories for existing owners of both the disc-based and Digital Edition PS5 consoles.[45]

Marvel's Spider-Man 2 received "universal acclaim" from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic,[46] with 97% of critics recommending the game on aggregator OpenCritic.[47]

Significant praise was directed towards the narrative and characterization of the primary cast. Gene Park, writing for The Washington Post, applauded the development and increasing tension between Peter Parker and Miles Morales, as well as the former's friendship with Harry Osborn, noting that it was pushed as far as possible in a fashion that was "satisfying to watch."[65] Matt Miller from Game Informer highlighted the story's effectiveness at deriving from philosophical concepts associated with heroism against villainy, recognizing the game's ability to pull from "questions about returning from a dark place and having another chance, no matter past mistakes." Miller also praised the game's effectiveness as an installment in a larger trilogy of games, able to standalone but is "made better by experiencing its entirety."[53]

In their 10/10 review of the game, Inverse directed praise towards the developer's seamless blend of ongoing narrative with the game mechanics, exemplifying the use of flashback sequences to teach the player about fundamental mechanics such as stealth and puzzle-solving, as well as the game's variation between quieter character-building, the minigames, and hallmark set-pieces during action sequences.[66]to go photorealistic".[26] Actor Graham Phillips was later announced to take over the role of Osborn from Porter during San Diego Comic-Con in July 2023.[11]
